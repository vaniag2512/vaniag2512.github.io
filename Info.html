    <h1> Information </h1>
    <p class="infoParagraph">
      There are many ways our water is being polluted. 
    </p>

<p class="infoParagraph">The agricultural industry releases pesticides, fertilizer, and animal waste into bodies of water everytime it rains.This leads to algae blooms that kills life and contaminates our drinking source. </p>
<p class="infoParagraph">Industries like food manufacturers, chemical manufacturers, pharmaceutical industries, paper manufacturers, etc can release chemicals into the ground or sewers. Wastewater treatment facilities do not completely clean out all chemicals as some chemicals not regulated under the Clean Water Act are not required to be cleaned out. Cleaning out chemicals also costs a lot of money. Many new chemicals are at times not even detected as there is no way to test for them. All of these issues lead to untreated waste water being released back into the environment</p>
<p class="infoParagraph">As more and more cities do this, cities downstream of rivers get the contaminated drinking water as all of the contaminants from upstream cities combine as they go down.</p>
 <p class="infoParagraph">Not to mention, plastic, oil spills, and radioactive substances can also reach bodies of water in the United States.</p>

    <div class="issuesInfo">
    <p> One of the chemical families that has been increasing worry is PFAS chemicals. There are over 12,000 chemicals in the PFAS family. They are found in any product that is water-resistant, grease-resistant, stain-resistant, non-stick, etc. They are also one of those chemicals that go undetected and are hard to clean out of water.
